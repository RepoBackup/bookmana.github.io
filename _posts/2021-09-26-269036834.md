## **요약**

●  Structural dynamics is an area that covers experimental, analytical, and computational methods for determining the response of structures to dynamic environments. Fundamentals of Structural Dynamics, 2nd Edition covers the theory of engineering vibration, with an emphasis on how to obtain models of real structures by finite-element-based computational techniques. It also emphasizes topics like mod...
